# HPC
Included are simply the original OpenMP code and my updated version. There are numerous other files but I feel as though my updated code is the main showcase of this project - I am happy to provide more details on the other solutions and code used to compile and test the different optimisations of these two .c files and the others - raw .c and MPI .c
